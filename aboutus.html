              <p> Service Tree leading manufacturer and exporter of high-quality RoHS(lead-free) and leaded soldering products.

                Service Tree have two plants with fully advanced automatic seprate machines for RoHS and Non RoHS soldering products. We are ISO 9001:2015 certified company.
                
                Our in-house laboratory is fully equipped with the latest equipment including a fully computerized Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, which gives a result with three-decimal accuracy. At each & every stage of production, the material is passed through a stringent quality control system and any possibility of substandard production is prevented.
                
                We have online testing facilities to detect the level of contamination in solder alloy and to ensure the continuity in the flow of flux in solder wire, as noncontinuity in flux in the wire may lead to dry soldering problems.
                
                We are actively advancing soldering technologies of the next generation, such as halogen-free flux, anti-cracking and low melting point solder alloy, in addition to existing high-quality soldering materials. Service Tree is a group of professionals specialized in soldering technologies. we are eager to contribute to the development and advancement of the global soldering industry with the latest technologies, quality excellence, and valuable services to provide.</p><br>
